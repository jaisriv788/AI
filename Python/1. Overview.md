## Data Types
1. **Integers** : Python can handle large integers within it self and i.e. up to 1e309(10^308).
2. **Decimals**: Limit for the it is 1.7e309(1.7^309).
3. **Boolean**: It either will be **True** or **False**.
4. **String**: Its form of text.
5. **Complex Number**: Its also handled by python but are used less.
6. **List**: Its just like array and is represented as [1,2,3,4].
7. **Tuple**: Its also like array but are represented with round brackets like (1,2,3,4).
8. **Sets**: Its like set in math and and is represented like {1,2,3,4}.
9. **Dictionary**: Its always written in the form of key value pair just like objects.                            e.g. {"name": "Nitish", "gender": "Male"}.

## Variables
- Below are the example to declare variables
```Python (exec)
#string
name = 'Jai Srivastava'
print(name)

#integer
num1 = 1
num2 = 2

print(num1 + num2)
```

- **Dynamic Typing** - It is process in python by which the data type of the value is auto assigned to the variable unlike other languages where we have to specify the type of the variables too.
- **Dynamic Binding** - In python when we create a variable for a particular data type it not fixed. Which means that we can assign any other data type to it also below is an example: 
```Python (exec)
a = 5
print(a)
#In here we will get 5 as value 

a = 'Jai'
print(a)
#In here we will get Jai as value 
```

- Below is a example telling how can we declare multiple variables in a single place instead of declaring them if different lines.
```Python (exec)
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

#Or we can write it as below 
a,b,c = 1,2,3
print(a,b,c)

#To assign same value to all the variables we can do the following
a = b = c = 5
print(a,b,c)
```
