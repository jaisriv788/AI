## Introduction

- In **Python**, strings are a sequence of Unicode Characters.
- String in **Python** are **immutable**.
- Below are the ways to declare a string :

```python
s1 = 'Hello'
s2 = "Hello"
s3 = '''Hello'''
s4 = """Hello"""

print(s1,s2,s3, sep="\n")
```

## Accessing Substrings From A String

```python (exec)
s = "hello"

# Positive Indexing
print(s[0])
print(s[1])
print(s[2])
print(s[3])
print(s[4]) 

# Negative Indexing
print(s[-1])
print(s[-2])
print(s[-3])
print(s[-4])
print(s[-5])
```

### Slicing

```python (exec)
s = "hello world"

print(s[2:7]) # This will slice the string from the range as provided
print(s[:]) # This will print the whole string
print(s[:7]) # This will brint from starting to the place mentioned
print(s[3:]) # This will have the starting from the 3 and will go upto the end
print(s[::2]) # Third argument will make the jump of the defined number

print(s[::-1]) # This the code to reverse a string.
```

- To **Delete** a string we use the del keyword with the variable name. like - del s.
- **Delete** actually does not delete the value itself in **Python** but instead it removes the reference attached to the variable and if reference count to the address becomes 0 then the Garbage Collector(GC) will automatically delete the address.

## Operators On String

- Their are 5 types of operators for string - 
  1. Arithmetic Operations
  2. Relational Operations
  3. Logical Operations
  4. Loops in Strings
  5. Membership Operations

```python (exec)

# Arithmetic Operations (Other than the + and * operators we do not have any operators in this operations)
print("Hello " + "World")
print("Hi" * 5)

# Relational Operations 
print("delhi" == "delhi")
print("delhi" != "delhi")
print("lucknow" > "delhi") # Here the check happen as lexiographically
print("lucknow" < "delhi") # Here the check happen as lexiographically

# Logical Operations
# In Python is the string contains charachers then its true and if its empty then its false
print("" and "world")
print("hello" and "world")

print("" or "world")
print("hello" or "world")

print(not "")
print(not "Hello")

# Loops in Strings
str = "hello"
for i in str:
	print(i)
	
# Membership Operators
print("d" in "delhi")
print("d" not in "delhi")
```

## Common Functions

```python (exec)
# len
print(len("hello"))

# max
print(max("hello"))

# min
print(min("hello"))

# sorted
print(sorted("hello"))
```

## Capitalize/Title/Upper/Lower/Swapcase

```python (exec)
s = "hello world"

print(s.capitalize())

print(s.title())

print(s.upper())

print(s.lower())

print(s.swapcase())
```

## Count/Find/Index

```python (exec)
s = "hi how are you?"

print(s.count("i"))
print(s.find("h"))
print(s.index("h"))

# index and the find methods are almost same the only difference is that if we serach something that is not present then the find will return us -1 but the index will provide us the error.
```
