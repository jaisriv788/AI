## Introduction

- In **Python**, strings are a sequence of Unicode Characters.
- String in **Python** are **immutable**.
- Below are the ways to declare a string :

```python
s1 = 'Hello'
s2 = "Hello"
s3 = '''Hello'''
s4 = """Hello"""

print(s1,s2,s3, sep="\n")
```

## Accessing Substrings From A String

```python (exec)
s = "hello"

# Positive Indexing
print(s[0])
print(s[1])
print(s[2])
print(s[3])
print(s[4]) 

# Negative Indexing
print(s[-1])
print(s[-2])
print(s[-3])
print(s[-4])
print(s[-5])
```

### Slicing

```python (exec)
s = "hello world"

print(s[2:7]) # This will slice the string from the range as provided
print(s[:]) # This will print the whole string
print(s[:7]) # This will brint from starting to the place mentioned
print(s[3:]) # This will have the starting from the 3 and will go upto the end
print(s[::2]) # Third argument will make the jump of the defined number

print(s[::-1]) # This the code to reverse a string.
```

- To **Delete** a string we use the del keyword with the variable name. like - del s.
- **Delete** actually does not delete the value itself in **Python** but instead it removes the reference attached to the variable and if reference count to the address becomes 0 then the Garbage Collector(GC) will automatically delete the address.

## Operators On String
