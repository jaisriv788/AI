## Operators

- When we have to perform an operation on two operands then that operation is done using operators. Their are 6 type of operators  - 
  1. Arithmetic Operators
  2. Relational Operators
  3. Logical Operators
  4. Bitwise Operators
  5. Assignment Operators
  6. Membership Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

```Python (exec)
print(5+6) # Addition

print(6-5) # Substraction

print(5*6) # Multiplication

print(5/2) # Division

print(5//2) #Integer Division

print(5%2) #  Modulus

print(5**2) # Power Of
```

### Relational Operators

```python (exec)
print(4>5) # Greater Than

print(4<5) # Less Than

print(4>=5) # Greater Than Equal To

print(4<=5) # Less Than Equal To

print(4==5) # Equal To

print(4!=5) # Not Equal To

```

### Logical Operators

```python (exec)
print(1 and 0) # And

print(1 or 0) # Or

print(not 1) # Not
```

### Bitwise Operators

```python (exec)
print(2 & 3) # Bitwise AND

print(2 | 3) # Bitwise OR

print(2 ^ 3) # Bitwise XOR

print(~3) # Bitwise NOT
# NOTE - Using two's complement we should always remember that ~n = -(n+1)

print(4 >> 2) # Right Shift

print(4 << 2) # Left Shift
```

### Assignment Operator

```python
# = 

a = 2
# In here a is variable, = is the assignment operator and 2 is the literal.

# We can us the it with other operator like below
a += 2
print(a)
```

### Membership Operator

```python (exec)
# in/not in
print('d' in 'Delhi')

print('D' in 'Delhi')

print('d' not in 'Delhi')

print('D' not in 'Delhi')

```

### Problem

- Print the sum of the digit of a 3 digit number entered by the user.

```python (exec)
num = int(input("Enter a 3 digit number : "))

sum = 0

a = num%10
num //= 10
sum += a

b = num%10
num //= 10
sum += b

c = num%10
num //= 10
sum += c

print("Sum of the number digits is", sum, sep=" : ")

```
