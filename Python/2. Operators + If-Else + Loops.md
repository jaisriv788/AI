## Operators

- When we have to perform an operation on two operands then that operation is done using operators. Their are 6 type of operators  - 
  1. Arithmetic Operators
  2. Relational Operators
  3. Logical Operators
  4. Bitwise Operators
  5. Assignment Operators
  6. Membership Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

```Python (exec)
print(5+6) # Addition

print(6-5) # Substraction

print(5*6) # Multiplication

print(5/2) # Division

print(5//2) #Integer Division

print(5%2) #  Modulus

print(5**2) # Power Of
```

### Relational Operators

```python (exec)
print(4>5) # Greater Than

print(4<5) # Less Than

print(4>=5) # Greater Than Equal To

print(4<=5) # Less Than Equal To

print(4==5) # Equal To

print(4!=5) # Not Equal To

```

### Logical Operators

```python (exec)
print(1 and 0) # And

print(1 or 0) # Or

print(not 1) # Not
```

### Bitwise Operators

```python (exec)
print(2 & 3) # Bitwise AND

print(2 | 3) # Bitwise OR

print(2 ^ 3) # Bitwise XOR

print(~3) # Bitwise NOT
# NOTE - Using two's complement we should always remember that ~n = -(n+1)

print(4 >> 2) # Right Shift

print(4 << 2) # Left Shift
```

### Assignment Operator

```python
# = 

a = 2
# In here a is variable, = is the assignment operator and 2 is the literal.

# We can us the it with other operator like below
a += 2
print(a)
```

### Membership Operator

```python (exec)
# in/not in
print('d' in 'Delhi')

print('D' in 'Delhi')

print('d' not in 'Delhi')

print('D' not in 'Delhi')

```

### Problem

- Print the sum of the digit of a 3 digit number entered by the user.

```python (exec)
num = int(input("Enter a 3 digit number : "))

sum = 0

a = num%10
num //= 10
sum += a

b = num%10
num //= 10
sum += b

c = num%10
num //= 10
sum += c

print("Sum of the number digits is", sum, sep=" : ")

```
## If-Else

- If-Else is used for condition based approach where their are logics based on true or false and they both have some task to execute. Below is the syntax for it : 

```python
if condition1:
    # runs if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # runs if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # another check
else:
    # runs if none of the above are True
```
### Problem

- Take email and password from the user and verify them to a dummy data and make him login or logout as per the email and password and print adequate message.

```python (exec)
email = input("Enter your email : " )
password = input("Enter your password : ")

if email=='jai@gmail.com' and password=='jai123':
   print("Successfully logged in")
else : 
   print("Failed to login. Either email or password is wrong")
```

- Now use elif and make the password condition in new elif section and if email is right and password is word is wrong the the use must have the change to correct it.

```python (exec)
email = input("Enter your email : " )
password = input("Enter your password : ")

if email=='jai@gmail.com' and password=='jai123':
    print("Successfully logged-in.")
elif email=='jai@gmail.com' and password!='jai123':
	retry_password = input("Re-enter your password : ")
	if(retry_password=='jai123'):
		print("Successfully logged-in.")
	else:
		print("Failed to login as you entered wrong password.")
else : 
    print("Failed to login. Either email or password is wrong")
```

## Modules In Python

- Its similar like library in C or C++ here we call it modules in python.

```python (exec)
# Math Module
import math

print(math.factorial(5))
print(math.floor(5.5))
print(math.ceil(5.5))
print(math.sqrt(16))
print(math.pow(5,2))
```

```python (exec)
# Keyword Module
import keyword

print(keyword.kwlist)
```

```python (exec)
# Random Module
import random

print(random.randint(1,100))
```

```python (exec)
# Datetime Module
import datetime

print(datetime.datetime.now())
```

- Here is how you can check all the modules in python.
```python (exec)
help('modules')
```
