## Operators

- When we have to perform an operation on two operands then that operation is done using operators. Their are 6 type of operators  - 
  1. Arithmetic Operators
  2. Relational Operators
  3. Logical Operators
  4. Bitwise Operators
  5. Assignment Operators
  6. Membership Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

```Python (exec)
print(5+6) # Addition

print(6-5) # Substraction

print(5*6) # Multiplication

print(5/2) # Division

print(5//2) #Integer Division

print(5%2) #  Modulus

print(5**2) # Power Of
```

### Relational Operators

```python (exec)
print(4>5) # Greater Than

print(4<5) # Less Than

print(4>=5) # Greater Than Equal To

print(4<=5) # Less Than Equal To

print(4==5) # Equal To

print(4!=5) # Not Equal To

```

### Logical Operators

```python (exec)
print(1 and 0) # And

print(1 or 0) # Or

print(not 1) # Not
```

### Bitwise Operators

```python (exec)
print(2 & 3) # Bitwise AND

print(2 | 3) # Bitwise OR

print(2 ^ 3) # Bitwise XOR

print(~3) # Bitwise NOT
# NOTE - Using two's complement we should always remember that ~n = -(n+1)

print(4 >> 2) # Right Shift

print(4 << 2) # Left Shift
```

### Assignment Operator

```python
# = 

a = 2
# In here a is variable, = is the assignment operator and 2 is the literal.

# We can us the it with other operator like below
a += 2
print(a)
```

### Membership Operator

```python (exec)
# in/not in
print('d' in 'Delhi')

print('D' in 'Delhi')

print('d' not in 'Delhi')

print('D' not in 'Delhi')

```

### Problem

- Print the sum of the digit of a 3 digit number entered by the user.

```python (exec)
num = int(input("Enter a 3 digit number : "))

sum = 0

a = num%10
num //= 10
sum += a

b = num%10
num //= 10
sum += b

c = num%10
num //= 10
sum += c

print("Sum of the number digits is", sum, sep=" : ")

```
## If-Else

- If-Else is used for condition based approach where their are logics based on true or false and they both have some task to execute. Below is the syntax for it : 

```python
if condition1:
    # runs if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # runs if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # another check
else:
    # runs if none of the above are True
```
### Problem

- Take email and password from the user and verify them to a dummy data and make him login or logout as per the email and password and print adequate message.

```python (exec)
email = input("Enter your email : " )
password = input("Enter your password : ")

if email=='jai@gmail.com' and password=='jai123':
   print("Successfully logged in")
else : 
   print("Failed to login. Either email or password is wrong")
```

- Now use elif and make the password condition in new elif section and if email is right and password is word is wrong the the use must have the change to correct it.

```python (exec)
email = input("Enter your email : " )
password = input("Enter your password : ")

if email=='jai@gmail.com' and password=='jai123':
    print("Successfully logged-in.")
elif email=='jai@gmail.com' and password!='jai123':
	retry_password = input("Re-enter your password : ")
	if(retry_password=='jai123'):
		print("Successfully logged-in.")
	else:
		print("Failed to login as you entered wrong password.")
else : 
    print("Failed to login. Either email or password is wrong")
```

## Modules In Python

- Its similar like library in C or C++ here we call it modules in python.

```python (exec)
# Math Module
import math

print(math.factorial(5))
print(math.floor(5.5))
print(math.ceil(5.5))
print(math.sqrt(16))
print(math.pow(5,2))
```

```python (exec)
# Keyword Module
import keyword

print(keyword.kwlist)
```

```python (exec)
# Random Module
import random

print(random.randint(1,100))
```

```python (exec)
# Datetime Module
import datetime

print(datetime.datetime.now())
```

- Here is how you can check all the modules in python.
```python (exec)
help('modules')
```

## Loops

- It is a process in which we have to repeat a certain piece of code again and again then we use loop. In python we have 2 types of loop :- 1.**while** and 2.**for**.
- Below are the example and the syntax of the loops :

```python
# This is the syntax

# 1. for
for variable in iterable:
    statement

# 2. while
while condition:
    statement

# 3. for with else
for variable in iterable:
    statement
else:
    statement
    
# 4. while with else
while condition:
    statement
else:
    statement
```

### While Loop

- Problem solving with basic while loop.

```python (exec)

# Problem - Take an input from a user and print the table of its using the while loop
num = int(input("Enter the number"))
start = 1

while start <= 10:
	print(num, " * ", start, " = ", num*start)
	start += 1
```

- Problem solving with while loop including the else.

```python (exec)
# Example of while loop with else.

x = 0

while x < 4:
    if x == 3:
     break
    print(x)
    x += 1
else:
    print('Limit crossed')

# In here we have a break statement. Maybe we should think what is its use when using the else so here is the use.
# When using break if the condition matches then and the code breaks the loop then the else part of the code will not run.
# As in the casr of not getting with the if block or the condition fails then the else will execute and print 'Limit crossed'.
```
#### Problem

- Randomly select a number between 1 to 100 user will guess a number then we have to navigate the user the the correct number and tell the user in how many attempts does the user have reached the correct number.

```python (exec)
import random

randomNumber = random.randint(1,100)

count = 0
guessNumber = 0

while guessNumber != randomNumber :
	guessNumber = int(input("Guess the number"))
	count +=1
	if guessNumber == randomNumber:
		print("You have guessed correct number in", count, "attepmts")
		break
	elif guessNumber < randomNumber:
		print("Number is greater then the number you gussed")
	else:
		print("Number is less then the number you gussed")	
```

### For Loop

- Print number from 1 to 10 using for loop

```python (exec)
for i in range(1,11):
	print(i, end=", ")
	
print("")

# We can also put the increment in the brackets after the range like this : 
# (start, end, jump/increment)
for i in range(1,11,2):
	print(i, end=", ")
	
print("")

# It is very useful for the reverse logics like to print number from 10 to 1
for i in range(10,0,-1):
	print(i, end=", ")
```

### Problem

- The current population of a town is 10000. The population of the town is increasing at the rate of  10% per year. You have to write a program to find out the population at the end of each of the last 10 years.

```python (exec)
population = 10000
increaseRate = 10

for i in range(1,11):
	population = int(population // 1.1)
	print("Population", i, "year ago was", population)
```

- We have to take an input from user as integer and then we have to print the series like this         1/1! + 2/2! + 3/3! + .... n/n!

```python (exec)
# This approach is from the library.
import math

n = int(input())

sum = 0

for i in range (1,n+1):
    sum += i/math.factorial(i)
    
print(sum)

# This is the more optimized approach.

n = int(input())

sum = 0
fact = 1

for i in range (1,n+1):
    fact = fact * i
    sum += i/fact
    
print(sum)
```
