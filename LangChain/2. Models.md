## What are models?
- The model component in LangChain is a crucial part of the framework, designed to facilitate interactions with various **Language models** and **Embedding Models**.
- It abstracts the complexity of working with different LLMs, chat models and embedding models, providing a uniform interface to communicate with them.

### Models Flow
- Below are the flow of the models that are being mentioned in the above image.

## Language Models
- These models are AI systems designed to process, generate and understand **Natural Language Text**.

- **LLMs :-** These are **General Purpose Models** that are used for raw **Text Generation**. They take string as input and return a string too. These can be used to create application like - **Text Generation, Summary Generation, Code Generation and Question Answering**. They are become older models and are being replaced by **Chat Models**.
- **Chat Models :-** These are specialized for **Conversational Task**. They take sequence of message as input and return chat message as output. These are relatively newer models and used more than LLMs.


| Feature              | LLMs (Base Models)                                                                  | Chat Models (Instruction Tuned)                                                    |

| **Purpose**          | Free-Form Text Generation.                                                          | Optimized for multi-turn conversation.                                             |
| **Training Data**    | General text like - books, articles etc.                                            | Fined-tuned on chat datasets(dialogues, user assistant conversation).              |
| **Memory & Context** | No built-in memory.                                                                 | Supports structured conversation history.                                          |
| **Role Awareness**   | No understanding of "user" and "assistant" roles.                                   | Understands "system", "user" and "assistant" roles.                                |
| **Example Models**   | GPT-3, Llama-2-78, Mistral-78, OPT-1.38                                             | GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama-2-Chat, Mistral-Instruct Claude.                       |
| **Use Cases**        | Text Generation, summarization translation, creative writing, code generation, etc. | Conversational AI, chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support, AI tutors, etc. |
